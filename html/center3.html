    <p>Type 5, 6 and 7 fire trucks are used in various ways depending on a fire department’s needs. For example, some trucks are used as a fire response unit and include a small EMS response kit, while other vehicles are equipped with a water tank and water pump and can provide water suppression resources before larger rigs arrive on the fire scene. This configuration is common in wildland environments, where they are often referred to as mini pumpers or brush trucks. When equipped with water suppression capabilities Type 5, 6 and 7 trucks typically carry a 300-gallon water tank and a small booster pump with a minimum capacity of 50 gallons per minute.</p>

    <p>A Type 2 fire truck features many of the same specifications and tools of the Type 1 fire truck. Type 2 trucks are not as common in fire departments, but they are versatile trucks that are often found in urban and suburban applications performing vehicle accident and rescue response as a first response unit or heavy rescue engine.

Type 2 trucks may be ideal for a fire department looking for a more compact rescue engine, wet rescue or heavy-duty rescue featuring a smaller water tank and pump, but with storage capabilities that can still hold a lot of equipment. A Type 2 truck is an ideal fire truck to arrive on the fire scene first to start fire extinguishing tasks until more support arrives.

Much like a Type 1 engine, a Type 2 engine typically carries 3 or 4 firefighters. It includes a lot of basic firefighting gear and tools, like SCBAs, circular saws, as well as many different types of specialized equipment.
