    <p>While it may not be a formal ‘type’ of a fire truck, the electric fire truck is making a name for itself in stations across the country.

Electric fire trucks are growing in demand as municipalities strive to meet environmental standards and to help reduce emissions, minimize fuel use and costs, and improve firefighters' safety with less exposure to carbon emissions.</p>

        A Type 3 fire truck is often referred to as a wildland fire truck or a brush truck. Typically used in rural and wildland settings, a Type 3 fire truck includes several unique design and configuration details to match the terrain it services.

Wildland fire trucks commonly sit on a commercial 4x4 chassis and can be used as wildland urban interface vehicles. They are designed to be sleek and maneuverable with the ability to manage off-road and variable terrain. Type 3 fire trucks are often responding to wildfires and must be able to get as close to the fire as possible while maintaining both stability and vehicle control. The Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) is often more than 26,000 lbs. and the vehicle must be equipped to carry at least 3 passengers.

NFPA standards require a Type 3 engine to have a minimum of a 500-gallon water tank and a pump capable of a minimum of 150 US gallons per minute at a pressure of 250 pounds per square inch.
