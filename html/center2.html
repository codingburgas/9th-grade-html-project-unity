    <p>A Type 1 fire truck, often referred to as an engine company, engine pumper or structural firefighting truck, is the most common type of fire engine in use today.

Type 1 fire trucks are purposefully designed to support urban, rural and suburban departments because they carry all of the required NFPA firefighting equipment. These versatile vehicles are often the first on the fire scene because they support both structural firefighting and initial Emergency Medical Service (EMS) response.

Every Type 1 truck is required to have a pump with a minimum tank size of 300 gallons, although most Type 1 trucks feature a 400- to 500-gallon water tank. Additionally, the truck must offer a minimum of 1000 Gallons Per Minute (GPM) of water transfer.</p>

    <p>A Type 3 fire truck is often referred to as a wildland fire truck or a brush truck. Typically used in rural and wildland settings, a Type 3 fire truck includes several unique design and configuration details to match the terrain it services.

Wildland fire trucks commonly sit on a commercial 4x4 chassis and can be used as wildland urban interface vehicles. They are designed to be sleek and maneuverable with the ability to manage off-road and variable terrain. Type 3 fire trucks are often responding to wildfires and must be able to get as close to the fire as possible while maintaining both stability and vehicle control. The Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) is often more than 26,000 lbs. and the vehicle must be equipped to carry at least 3 passengers.

NFPA standards require a Type 3 engine to have a minimum of a 500-gallon water tank and a pump capable of a minimum of 150 US gallons per minute at a pressure of 250 pounds per square inch.</p>
