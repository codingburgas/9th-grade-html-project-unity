    <p>A Type 1 fire truck, often referred to as an engine company, engine pumper or structural firefighting truck, is the most common type of fire engine in use today.

Type 1 fire trucks are purposefully designed to support urban, rural and suburban departments because they carry all of the required NFPA firefighting equipment. These versatile vehicles are often the first on the fire scene because they support both structural firefighting and initial Emergency Medical Service (EMS) response.

Every Type 1 truck is required to have a pump with a minimum tank size of 300 gallons, although most Type 1 trucks feature a 400- to 500-gallon water tank. Additionally, the truck must offer a minimum of 1000 Gallons Per Minute (GPM) of water transfer.</p>

    <p>A Type 2 fire truck features many of the same specifications and tools of the Type 1 fire truck. Type 2 trucks are not as common in fire departments, but they are versatile trucks that are often found in urban and suburban applications performing vehicle accident and rescue response as a first response unit or heavy rescue engine.

Type 2 trucks may be ideal for a fire department looking for a more compact rescue engine, wet rescue or heavy-duty rescue featuring a smaller water tank and pump, but with storage capabilities that can still hold a lot of equipment. A Type 2 truck is an ideal fire truck to arrive on the fire scene first to start fire extinguishing tasks until more support arrives.</p>
